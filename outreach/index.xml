This idea will implement a DMA-BUF backend and a client-side API for high performance image capturing and transformations on the GPU. The new backend and api should enable high performance streaming over applications like OBS using our custom desktop portal backend.</description></item><item><title>GSOC 2024 Contributors for Waycrate</title><link>https://waycrate.github.io/outreach/gsoc/2024/contributors/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://waycrate.github.io/outreach/gsoc/2024/contributors/</guid><description>GSOC 2024 Contributors Selected!
